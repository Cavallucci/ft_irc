- **Private Messaging**: Users can send private messages to other users within the IRC network.
- **User Authentication**: User accounts can be created and authenticated to ensure secure communication.
- **Command-based Interface**: Both the server and client utilize a command-based interface for interaction and control.
- **Message Formatting**: The project supports formatting options for messages, such as bold, italics, and colors.
- **Moderation Tools**: Administrators have access to moderation tools for managing channels and users.
- **File Sharing**: Users can share files within the IRC network.
